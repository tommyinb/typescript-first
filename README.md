This is another xxx-first project for quick project startup - TypeScript this time.

## First

1. clone the project
2. run `npm i` to install all dependencies
3. run `npm run start`
4. open the folder your editor or **VScode**
5. run `npm run dev` for **watch** mode
6. edit the source files
7. program will re-run on file change
8. run `npm run test` to run tests
9. can also run all above commands in VScode as _launch.json_ is included in project

Happy TypeScript programming ðŸ™‚
